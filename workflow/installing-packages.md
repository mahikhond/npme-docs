# Installing Packages

You install private modules in exactly the same way that you install any other
npm module:

1. Follow the steps outlined in the [CLI Configuration] documentation, to generate a token in your
  `.npmrc` file.
2. Follow the steps in [Publishing Packages], to publish your first scoped module.
3. Run `npm install @mycompany/my-test-module`, to install the private module
  that you published in the prior step.

[CLI Configuration]: /cli/configuration.md
[Publishing Packages]: /workflow/publishing-packages.md
